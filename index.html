 <!--Introduction-->

<div class="container">
<h2>Project Overview</h2><br>
  <h>Collaborators: Bridget Larkin, Zeid Yaghnam, Benjamin Preiss, and Molly Verano</h>
  <br><br>

  <b>What is Charity Gaming?</b>
<p>Charity Gaming is a non-profit charity that provides children in hospitals with video games and consoles through streaming fundraisers. </p>


<!--Problem Statement-->

 <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="display-4">What is the Problem?</h1>
      <p class="lead">Video games provide children in hospitals with an opportunity to play, and organizations like Charity Gaming are important in providing devices and consoles to patients and families during their time in hospitals. Despite their uplifting mission, Charity Gaming’s current site does not inspire the kind of participation needed to carry out their goals.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  </p>
<b>The Solution</b>
<p>Providing a refreshed redesign of the current website in which users will know more about Charity Gaming’s effort and understand the impacts of their work. The new design will help gain the trust of users, increasing the potential for donations and streamers. 
  </p>
<br><br>


<!--Research-->
<h2>User Research</h2><br>
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-body">
        User Interviews (Qualitative research):
        My team members and I conducted user interviews with friends and families who contribute to charities. We asked them general open ended questions as well as more specific questions to get relevant data. Below are some of the questions we asked:
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">How do you usually build trust with a charity? What do they do to prove your donation is effective?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">What is a pain point that you come across when wanting to donate to a cause?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">In what ways do you feel a sincere ‘thank you’ for donating to a charity? (example: phone call, email, handwritten letter, small gift, etc.)</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">When donating to a cause, what emotions influence you more to donate?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">What are other ways you like to contribute other than donating?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Have you had experience with videogames in the past?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Have you ever considered donating to charities that use their funds to buy video games and consoles to kids in hospitals?</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Why do you feel it’s important/unimportant to donate to provide video games and consoles to children in hospitals?</li> 
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>In addition to interviewing users, we created a user persona and an empathy map with the data collected from user interviews. These helped us to make further decisions throughout the design process.

<!--Iterations-->


<h2>Design Iterations</h2>
  <p> Our designs went through several rounds of iterations before we landed on a design we felt best serves the interests of Charity Gaming and its users.
